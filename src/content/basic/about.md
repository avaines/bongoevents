Founded in 2020, Bongo Events sets out to bring the best in events and marketing, specializing in the food and beverage industry.

Aly Bongo started her career in events and marketing in 2015 in Hong Kong. Working primarily in the beauty and spa industry, she developed a passion for bringing people together with curated events. From intimate wellness workshops, Girls Night Out events totaling at 300 people, Aly has always had a knack for finding a niche and using it to bring people together for a good time.

Aly has worked with some of the world's top brands across many industries including Lâ€™Occitane, Armani, Uber, CE LA VI, Vita Coco, and many more, helping elevate their brands through synergy based partnerships and events.

Since moving back to the UK in 2019, Aly has since worked in retail marketing & events as well as charity marketing before making the decision to set out on her own and build a company that focuses on developing creative ideas to light and bringing the local communities together.
